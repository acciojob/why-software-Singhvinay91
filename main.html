	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems and building things that have a real impact. I love the challenge of learning new technologies and applying them to create useful applications. Development gives me the chance to combine creativity and logic, while also offering strong career opportunities and the satisfaction of seeing my ideas come to life.</p>
